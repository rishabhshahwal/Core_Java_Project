# 🎬 BookMyShow – Core Java Console Project

This is a **console-based Core Java project** that simulates a simplified version of the popular **BookMyShow** platform.  
It demonstrates the use of **Core Java concepts** such as classes & objects, constructors, collections, and exception handling in a real-world application scenario.

---

## 📖 Overview

The project provides a ticket booking system where users can:

- Browse available trains/movies/shows  
- Select and book tickets  
- Manage bookings  
- View details through a console-driven menu  

It is designed as a **learning project** to strengthen Core Java fundamentals while applying them in a practical, real-world context.

## ✨ Features

- **Console-driven interface** with menu navigation  
- **Train / Movie / Show booking system**  
- Use of **constructors and OOP principles** (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- **Collections** (e.g. `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) for storing and managing data  
- **Exception handling** for invalid input and error scenarios  
- Modular class design for scalability and maintainability
